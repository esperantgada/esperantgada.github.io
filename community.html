              <h2> WHAT DEVELOPMENT IS</h2>
              <p> Developed Country is one that allows all its citizens to enjoy a free and healthy life in a safe environment.” – Kofi Annan, The former General Secretary of the UN.

A country is said to be a developed country when the country is economically, technologically and educationally sound, that is why a developed country is also called a “more economically developed country”. The development of an economy is measured in terms of the Gross domestic product, Per capita income, gross national product of a country.

The human development index of the developed countries is higher in comparison to the developing countries. The living standard of the people, the literacy ratio, and the life expectancy. 

The post-industrial economy is the basic feature of the developed countries. These countries economy is based on the service sector. Whereas, the developing countries are in the process of transition. Moving from the pre-industrial to post-industrial era. The least developed countries have an agrarian based economy.

Here are a few sustainable elements that will create a country a developed country:

The poverty line: a country can become developed if the concept of below poverty line goes away from the country. The countries which are not developed are fighting this evil. The BIMARU states of India are poorer than the 26 countries of Africa. The combined population of the USA is 318 million and the people living below the poverty line in India are 276 million.
Safety of the people: India is the fourth dangerous country for the security of the women. In a developed country the people should feel secure and safe. Iceland, Denmark, Australia, and New Zealand are the top four safest countries in the world.
The hunger index: in a developed country, even the poor should have an access to three times meal. The hunger ratio decides the status of a country. India ranks 97 out of 118 countries in the global hunger index.
Literacy ratio:  the average literacy rate of the world is 84% of the total population of all the nation, whereas the literacy ratio of India as per the 2011 census is 74%. Education is an essential criterion in making a country developed.
Religious tolerance: a country should rise above religion. Indians spend most of their time in discussing supremacy of their religion, whereas, in the developed nation, people think about increasing their economy.
Transport system: a developed nation have metalled roads and new technologies. There are many cities in developing countries where the villages are not even connected to main roads. 
The Mayor of Bogota, rightly said that “a developed country is not a place where the poor have cars, it’s where the rich uses public transport”.
