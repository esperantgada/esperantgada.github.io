        <h1> C LANGUAGE: INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0D9zGIQXQEIZFYD9tpRXgQHaD1?w=316&h=179&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="C language">
        <p> C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an oper\
ating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmi\
ngs like an operating system or compiler development.
          Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on \
the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).
          Beginning with C programming:

 Structure of a C program
          After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C pro\
gram in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error.
          The structure of a C program is as follows:



          The components of the above structure are:
          Header Files Inclusion: The first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program.
          A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.
          Some of C Header files:
          stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
          stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
          stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
          stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, memory allocation
          string.h – Defines string handling functions
          math.h – Defines common mathematical functions
          Main Method Declaration: The next part of a C program is to declare the main() function. The syntax to declare the main function is:
          Syntax to Declare the main method:

          int main()
          {}

 Variable Declaration: The next part of any C program is the variable declaration. It refers to the variables that are to be used in the function. Please note that in the C progra\
m, no variable can be used without being declared. Also in a C program, the variables are to be declared before any operation in the function.
          Example:

          int main()
          {
          int a;
          .
          .

          Body: The body of a function in the C program, refers to the operations that are performed in the functions. It can be anything like manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, \
etc.
          Example:

          int main()
          {
          int a;

          printf("%d", a);
          .
          .
 Return Statement: The last part of any C program is the return statement. The return statement refers to the returning of the values from a function. This return statement and re\
turn value depend upon the return type of the function. For example, if the return type is void, then there will be no return statement. In any other case, there will be a return statement\
 and the return value will be of the type of the specified return type.
           In a C program, all lines that start with # are processed by a preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler. In a very basic term, the preprocessor takes a C program \
and produces another C program. The produced program has no lines starting with #, all such lines are processed by the preprocessor. In the above example, the preprocessor copies the prepr\
ocessed code of stdio.h to our file. The .h files are called header files in C. These header files generally contain declarations of functions. We need stdio.h for the function printf() us\
ed in the program.
              Line 2 [ int main(void) ] There must be a starting point from where execution of compiled C program begins. In C, the execution typically begins with the first line of main()\
. The void written in brackets indicates that the main doesn’t take any parameter (See this for more details). main() can be written to take parameters also. We will be covering that in fu\
ture posts.
              The int was written before main indicates return type of main(). The value returned by main indicates the status of program termination. See this post for more details on the\
 return type.
              Line 3 and 6: [ { and } ] In C language, a pair of curly brackets define scope and are mainly used in functions and control statements like if, else, loops. All functions mus\
t start and end with curly brackets.
              Line 4 [ printf(“GeeksQuiz”); ] printf() is a standard library function to print something on standard output. The semicolon at the end of printf indicates line termination. \
In C, a semicolon is always used to indicate end of a statement.
              Line 5 [ return 0; ] The return statement returns the value from main(). The returned value may be used by an operating system to know the termination status of your program.\
 The value 0 typically means successful termination.

              How to execute the above program:              Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above

        <h1> JAVA LANGUAGE</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/thumb/2/2e/Java_Logo.svg/1200px-Java_Logo.svg.png" alt="JAVA">
        <p> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose program\
ming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for re\
compilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java \
is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are \
typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for client-se\
rver web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[20]

          Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java pl\
atform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compl\
iance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtu\
al Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux dist\
ributions.

          As of March 2021, the latest version is Java 16, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zer\
o-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely\
. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.</p>

        <P> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]

          Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]

          Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]

          Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37][38].</P>

           <h1> KOTLIN LANGUAGE</h1>
           <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jP-6BxHaaQ0D7bn5k-NRlQHaBp?w=326&h=77&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="Kotlin">
        <P> Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/)[6] is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[7] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React[8]) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.[9] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.[10]

          On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.[11] Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 16, for optimization,[12] or allows for more features, e.g. Java 8 related with Kotlin 1.4,[13] and has experimental record class support for Java 16 compatibility.[14]

          Kotlin support for JavaScript (i.e. classic back-end) is considered stable in Kotlin 1.3 by its developers, while Kotlin/JS (IR-based) in version 1.4, is considered alpha. Kotlin/Native Runtime</P>

            <h1> PHP LANGUAGE</h1>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0nJ43FpUf2wefbxzxb-wZQHaD_?w=285&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="PHP language">
        <p> PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

          PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

          PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.

          It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

          PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.

          PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.

          PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.

          PHP Syntax is C-Like.

          Common uses of PHP
          PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them.

          PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send data, return data to the user.

          You add, delete, modify elements within your database through PHP.

          Access cookies variables and set cookies.

          Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.

          It can encrypt data.

          Characteristics of PHP
          Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible −

          Simplicity
          Efficiency
          Security
          Flexibility
          Familiarity
          "Hello World" Script in PHP
          To get a feel for PHP, first start with simple PHP scripts. Since "Hello, World!" is an essential example, first we will create a friendly little "Hello, World!" script.

          If you examine the HTML output of the above example, you'll notice that the PHP code is not present in the file sent from the server to your Web browser. All of the PHP present in the Web page is processed and stripped from the page; the only thing returned to the client from the Web server is pure HTML output.

          All PHP code must be included inside one of the three special markup tags ATE are recognised by the PHP Parser.


          From the next chapter we will start with PHP Environment Setup on your machine and then we will dig out almost all concepts related to PHP to make you comfortable with the PHP language.</p>

        <h1> JAVASCRIPTS LANGUAGE</h1>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.nGKbSUutoJ9juq0lIYWlJQHaEB?w=328&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="JAVASCRIPTS">
        <p> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

          Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

        <h1> HTML AND CSS</h1>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Nj27NP1-r0R20t4NdNLZCAHaEy?w=246&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="HTML/CSS">
        <p> HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. Learn more below about:

          What is HTML?
          HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:

          Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
          Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
          Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
          Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
          With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.


          What is XHTML?
          XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML, the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application, you can use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming XML content).

          What is CSS?
          CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

          What is WebFonts?
          WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the Web without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until recently, downloadable fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack of an interoperable font format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF").</p>
