                <h1> MY HISTORY</h1>
                <p> There is nobody on this earth who doesn't have history,even if it's shoter than everything. So everyone has his own story. Mine can be summazied as this. As many people in all other the world, I'm from a poor family and I'm proud of my family. This is the Creator of everything wanted for me. It will be my turn, my duty to take care of my family and build my own family which will be rich.<br>
                I started my primary school in a village. It wasn't easy for me.My mother, one of my elder brothers and I were known as jobbers. We did everything we saw in order to get money. We woke up at 4 :o'clock am to point under mangoes trees with lights to pick mangoes we brought at roadside. The goal was to sell them to passengers and we did that. Sometimes, we stayed there till the noon. We have done many things.<br>
                When I passed in the third form of primary school, I was sent in a town called Bohicon. It is in that city I got all my national certificates. As  far as my first certification is concerned, the primary study certificate, I was selected to start my secondary studies in military academy because I was among the best pupils of my city at this first national examination but unfortunately, I didn't take part to the  small examination that should be taken by each selected candidat. This day we were informed in the center that the exam was already held the previous day, my headmaster started weeping, he accompaigned me to the center. Perhaps, I have been unlucky.<br>
                After all that, I started my secondary studies in one of the biggest Bohicon's colleges called CEG4. I worked hard during all the time I passed in this college. This was what helped me being the top of my classes from the primary school till the fifth form of secondary school. I've been the top of my college three times consecutively. But with my conditions, I lost my place of class top from the second class of second cycle. Everething became hard form me, school accountance started dismissing me because of school fees. My elder brothers who were helping me, at a moment and with their needs and charges, became unable to help me. They weren't in peace to do that and I understood. So I was obliged to leave courses for jobs in order to pay my school fees. By doing this, my marks started decreasing and my average till Terminal. A father of my church has been informed about how I work at school and the conditions in which I was at this moment; he was informed through some church brothers who knew my performance at school. And as the father is rich, he decided to help me and he did it. His name is TONON Marcellin, a generous man who used to do many things as helps to orphans, widows... <br>
                To be short, during my first Baccalaureate taken successfully in 2018, I didn't work well as I wished and it was difficult for me to be enrolled in a school at university and I didn't want to do it. In my mind, taking another baccalaureate would be the best choice. But with the tips of one of teachers who loved me very well, I was enrolled in a faculty called FASEG at the university of Abomey-Calavi to study economy. But when I started, it was't easy for me. It seemed that I hadn't nobody in my life. I went to course at 4: o'clock am to 6: o'clock pm without eating. I did this during weeks. It was in the evening I arrived to find something I ate. With all this and the fact I didn't plan to study economy after my Baccalaureate, I started searching jobs, just to satisfy my needs. And I found one: cleaner. Despite the fact the location of the job was very far from where I was in Calavi, I tried to go there everyday. It was a game center created by a Chinese in Cotonou. I left completely university and contiued with my job. I was preparing myself to take another Baccalaureate. So I lost one year (2018-2019). For the year 2019-2020, I bought my school materials, uniform, everything I needed to take again the Terminal,myself. I did this in the first college of Abomey-Calavi (CEG1). And I did it despite the fact it was diddficult for me to eat at school and at home. Those who understood I've already started my study asked me why I wore college uniform to take again the Baccalaureate and I responded them it due to my goals.<br>
                Finally, I passed successfully this second Baccalaureate and by the grace of God, I was selected by Mastercard Foundation. It is this organization that supports me now. It changed my life.I'm studying software engineering today due to this organzation. God has a plan for everyone. We just need to hope, work hard, be determined, persevere and with our courage and God, we'll get what we deserve. Never lose hope in any situation. Espérant GADA.</p>
